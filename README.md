# Welcome to my Profile
Hey and welcome to my profile! Nice to meet you :D
## Introduction
My name is Noah and i am currently 18 years old. Im probably not as good as you in programming but I still have fun with it.
My favourite language is Java (because its the only i can program in) and I am currently learning JavaScript with coding a Discord bot in it.
I also like building Legos and play Billard with my friends.

## Projects
This is an overview of all currently public Projects I have
### [NUBot](https://github.com/Leguan16/NUBot)
NUBot is a Discord bot written in JS. Its basically my "how to JS" since its my first project in JS.
### [discord4jBot](https://github.com/Leguan16/discord4jBot)
This repo is currently just a dead repo. I created it a day before I realized how cool it is to program in JS
### [countdown](https://github.com/Leguan16/countdown)
This is a little website to display the time until my birthday
